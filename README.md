# StrikeAI
I began martial arts & programming the same time, and this project blends both of my 2 biggest passions! Lately I've been learning how to strike, but cant train myself at home. The issue with rely on shadow-boxing is that theres no way to correct poor form, and if it goes on long enough you end up hard drilling poor form and habits into your striking. StrikeAI helps watch me when I'm shadow boxing/sparring and gives me live feedback on my form. While watching me shadow box, it critiques primarily my usage of footwork, striking form and posture. While watching me spar, it detects which person I am and tries to give me feedback on how I can improve (Was I being too aggressive? Could I be more offensive?)
